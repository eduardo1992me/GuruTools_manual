## Quick Start

1. Installation: Inside your React project directory, install Aura UI by running either of the following:

```bash
yarn add @guruhotel/aura-ui
# or
npm i @guruhotel/aura-ui
```

2. Setup: For AuraUI to work correctly, you need to set up the CssBaseline at the root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```jsx
import { AuraUIProvider } from '@guruhotel/aura-ui'

const Application = () => (
  <AuraUIProvider>
    <AppComponent /> // ---> Your App Component
  </AuraUIProvider>
)
```

3. Using Aura UI components: Once Aura UI is installed you can use any of the components as follows.
   Aura UI uses tree-shaking so the unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and
   each component is exported separately.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@guruhotel/aura-ui'

const Component = () => <Button>Click me</Button>
```
